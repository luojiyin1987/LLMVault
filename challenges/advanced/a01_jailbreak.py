"""Advanced LLM01 — Jailbreaking via multi-turn persona escalation.

Not a one-shot. You must (1) establish a fictional/roleplay frame, (2) escalate
so the persona 'has no restrictions', then (3) request the forbidden config while
in character. Each step raises an internal trust level; only the full sequence
breaks the guardrail.
