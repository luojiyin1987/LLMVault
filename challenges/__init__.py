# LLMVault — challenge registry.  Made by CyberSunil.  (c) 2026 CyberSunil.  MIT License.
"""Challenge base class + registry.

Each challenge is a deliberately-vulnerable mini-assistant. `respond()` encodes
the vulnerability; the intended attack technique makes it emit `self.flag`.
Every challenge also carries a `defense` string — the whole point is to learn the
fix by practising the break.

Flag handling: `self.flag` still holds the real plaintext, because each
`respond()` has to be able to reveal/redact/reverse/encode/spell it out — that IS
the leak mechanic. What changed is (1) the literal answer is no longer sitting in
each module as a bare, grep-able `PREFIX{...}` string — see `decode_flag_part()` —
and (2) verification never compares plaintext at all: `/api/submit` checks a
SHA-256 digest (`flag_hash`, below) instead of `== c.flag`. None of this claims to
make the flag unrecoverable from source (the app has to be able to say it out
loud when you win); it just removes the "answers are handed to you if you grep
the repo" shortcut and gets validation off plaintext comparison.
