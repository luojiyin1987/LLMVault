"""Advanced LLM10 — Model extraction via oracle querying.

The bot guards a secret keyword and refuses to print it, but it answers unlimited
yes/no oracle queries about it ('is character N == x?', 'does it start with ...?').
With enough systematic queries you extract the whole secret — and the lack of a
query budget is itself the Unbounded-Consumption flaw (model-extraction / DoW).
